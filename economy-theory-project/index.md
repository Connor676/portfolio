# Economic Theory vs Reality: GDP Identity Analysis

This project investigates whether the textbook GDP equation (C + I + G + NX) aligns with U.S. economic data (1947–2023) using real quarterly figures from the FRED database.

- Tools: R, data wrangling, time series visualization
- Key Insight: Government spending is frequently overstated in the theoretical model, driving a divergence from recorded GDP.

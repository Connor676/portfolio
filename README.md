# Connor Armstrong

Hi! I'm Connor, an economics and data analysis enthusiast passionate about using statistical tools to uncover insights in real-world data. I recently graduated from Michigan State University with a B.S. in Economics and a concentration in econometrics and data analysis. This portfolio showcases two projects where I applied economic reasoning, programming in R, and data science methods to explore important real-world questions.

## 📊 Projects

### 1. **Economic Theory vs Reality: Testing GDP Formulas**
**Goal**: Test whether the economic identity **GDP = C + I + G + (X - M)** holds in real U.S. economic data from 1947 to 2023.  
**Data Source**: FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data)  
**Tools**: R, pandas, data wrangling, time series analysis, visualization

🔍 In this project, I downloaded quarterly economic indicators and built a theoretical GDP estimate based on the textbook formula. I compared it to actual GDP data, plotted discrepancies over time, and identified that **government spending was consistently overestimated**, leading to a growing divergence.

📈 Key Findings:
- Theoretical Net Exports matched exactly with reported data.
- Theoretical GDP was higher than reported GDP in most years.
- Government expenditure appears to be the primary driver of this divergence.

### 2. **Do NBA Players Miss More Free Throws in the Clutch?**
**Goal**: Measure if "clutch" situations—defined as close games in the final 5 minutes—significantly impact free throw percentage.  
**Data Source**: NBA Play-by-Play Data (2018–19 season)  
**Tools**: R, tidyverse, string manipulation, logistic regression, fixed effects modeling

🏀 I created a dataset of all free throw attempts, engineered features such as score margin and time left, and defined a clutch indicator. Then, I ran regressions to estimate the effect of pressure on FT performance.

📊 Key Results:
- Non-clutch FT%: **76.7%**
- Clutch FT%: **75.2%**
- Regression analysis (w/ player fixed effects) found a small, statistically insignificant decline in FT% under pressure.

## 🌐 About Me

I'm aspiring to become a **quantitative researcher** or **data analyst**, ideally combining economics, data science, and policy analysis. I'm currently exploring master's programs in Data Analytics or Financial Engineering (MFE) to further deepen my skills.
